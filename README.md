# Insta-Cats App built with Vue 3 + Vite
Insta-Cats is a basic app that features
- User Signup
- View all photos with preview images
- View comment on post
- Upload photo
- Test coverage

## Scripts

To install dependencies and run main app, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To run vitest files, use:
```bash
npm run test
```

To run test coverage, use:
```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Some Project Notes
- Implementing virtual lists would probably help with render performance
- Test coverage needs work
